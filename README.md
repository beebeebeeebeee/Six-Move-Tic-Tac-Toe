# Six-Move Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game using React and TypeScript. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. Two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

The game also has a unique feature where it only keeps the last 6 moves in the history. If a player makes a 7th move, their earliest move is undone. This adds an interesting twist to the traditional Tic Tac Toe game.
